Step 1: Cleaning and filter data in dataset including:
		- Filter data to only from 2020-01-01 to 2022-12-31 (Filter/Sort)
		- Check/Remove duplication (Remove Duplicates function)
		- Format date column and any number columns 
		- Fill 'null' for blank cells in any text/string columns, and 0 for any int/float columns (this help in import CSV file to MySQL through load 			data infile process)
Step 2: Seperate dataset into 2 *csv files: covid_death and covid_vaccination (to practice joining table and create viewing in MySQL)
Step 3: Load 2 *csv files to MySQL and start doing data exploration.
